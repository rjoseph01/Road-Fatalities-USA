# Road-Fatalities-USA
Currently displays information for NY and NJ Fatal Road Accidents

The Data folder is technically not referenced by the site because all data used in the project is included in the form of javascript files.

The data files are included in the form of geojson and csv for New York and New Jersey as utilized in the site. The additional larger files containing all the accident data for the United States is usable but significantly slows down the load time of the site. I have included those files for reference purposes.
